## 2026-10-20 — Sudoku engine, steps 1–3
- **Step 1, full grid** (`engine/sudoku/fullGrid.ts`): fills cell by cell with 1–9 in random order, and backs up
  when stuck. Check: 200 grids all valid and all different, and a deliberately broken grid gets caught.
- **Step 2, erase** (`countSolutions.ts`, `erase.ts`): erases cells in random order and keeps an erase only if
  the checker still finds exactly one answer. The checker tries every possibility and stops counting at 2.
  Erasing as far as possible left about 25 numbers. Check: 10 erased puzzles each have exactly one answer.
- **Step 3, grade** (`techniques.ts`, `grade.ts`): three human tricks, easiest first: Last cell (in a box, row or
  column), Only spot (in a box, row or column), Only number for cell. Each move carries a plain-English "why",
  which will become the hint's Explain text. If the tricks finish the puzzle, it's Easy. Seen so far: puzzles
  with 40, 34 or 30 numbers left were Easy; one with 26 got stuck. Check: every trick move in 20 puzzles
  matched the real answer.
- **Lesson:** a new check caught a real bug. The checker counted a full grid that broke a rule as "1 answer".
  Fixed: it now rejects rule-breaking givens up front.

## 2026-10-20 — Project set up
- Took over from a Claude Chat agent. Unzipped its handoff into `docs/02 Hand-off from Chat/`.
- Created the docs layout (same shape as CheckBuddy). Local git repo started.
